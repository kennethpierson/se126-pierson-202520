#PROGRAM PROMPT: All end devices using IPv4 on a network require an IP address. IP addresses are classified as Class A, Class B Class C, Class D, or Class E. For the most part network administrators work with Class A, B, and C. Knowing an IP addressâ€™s class also reveals to you its default subnet mask, which can then be used to identify its network and host IDs. Each IP address consists of 4 octets. The first octet determines the class. 
#Write a program that will allow the user to enter as many IP addresses that they want. Each time an IP address is entered, the program should display back to the user: the full IP address, its class, and the classâ€™s default subnet mask. For each IP address entered by the user, when redisplayed by the program, should appear exactly as it did when entered by the user including its . ). If the IP address is not a Class A, B, C, D, or E, the user should also be alerted and the entered IP address should still be reprinted.

#Class A - 1 - 127
#Class B - 128 - 191
#Class C - 192 - 223
#Class D - 224 - 239
#Class E - 240 - 255
