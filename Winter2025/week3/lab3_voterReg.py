#Construct a program that will analyze potential voters. The program should generate the following totals:
#1. Number of individuals not eligible to register.
#2. Number of individuals who are old enough to vote but have not registered.
#3. Number of individuals who are eligible to vote but did not vote.
#4. Number of individuals who did vote.
#5. Number of records processed.
#The program must prompt the user for the ID number, age, if the person is registered to vote, and if the person voted. You will also have to prompt to see if the user has more data to enter.

#VARIABLE DICTIONARY
