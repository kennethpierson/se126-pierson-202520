#W7D2 - Live Class: Review of Binary Search & Bubble Sort + 2D Lists

#This demo uses the file: simple.csv (also named simple-2.csv)

#this start file contains a "shell" program, or a coded outline, for the full working program we will build in class to review bubble sort and binary search, as well as introduce basic processing of 2D lists

import csv 


def menu():
    print("Simple Searching Menu")
    print("1. Search by NAME")
    print("2. Search by NUM")
    print("3. Search by COLOR")
    print("4. EXIT")

    menu_choice = input("Enter your search type [1-4]: ")
    return menu_choice

def swap(index, listName):
    temp = listName[index]
    listName[index] = listName[index + 1]
    listName[index + 1] = temp


#create your empty 1D parallel lists

nums = []
colors = []

#we will use the below hand-populated list
valid_menu = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]

with open("text_files/simple.csv") as csvfile: 
    file = csv.reader(csvfile)

    for rec in file: 
        names.append(rec[0])

#disconnected from file-----------------------

while ans == "y":
    choice = menu()

    if choice != "1" and choice != "2" and choice != "3" and choice != "4": 
        print("!INVALID ENTRY!\nPlease try again.\n")

    elif choice == "1": #search by NAME
        print("\n~Search by NAME~")


    elif choice == "2": #search by NUM

        print("\n~Search by COLOR~")


    else:
        print("\n~EXIT~")

print("\nThank you for using my program.\n\t\tGOODBYE!\n")


#------2D Lists ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2D lists are just lists that contain 1D lists inside of them!
